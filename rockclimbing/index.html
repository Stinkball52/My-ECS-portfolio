	<p/> I have climbed well into the intermediate grades of both top rope and bouldering<p/>
	  <p/> My coaches are a huge insporation because they make me push myself to get better at many forms of climbing</p>
	   <p/>When i was about 5 or 6 took a climbing class for 3 months but after that I fell out of doing it due to basketball.

	I eventually started 
	  up soccer and played that for a year but I quit and went back to climbing which is what I have been doing for almost 3 years.</p>
	<p/> A key insight into rock climbing that I wish I knew when I was starting out was that if you put in the time to core workouts and do 
	conditioning often you will get much stronger and feel better about your climbing skill.</p>
